**Mana** empowers game developers by making it easy to write fast, modular, and reliable code, while still having all the flexibility of a high-level scripting language. 

**Mana**'s motto is to have it both ways: *Write Fast, Run Fast.*

It achieves this by being a **hybrid** language whose modules can be *selectively embedded* for high-level scripting, or compiled directly to machine code. This allows developers to get high performance while still being able to modify code in a running app; all without requiring any glue or hand-rolled scripting language.

Additionally, **Mana** is designed to let you write expressive and modular code *without* sacrificing performance. 

It is a data-oriented language, meaning that everything in **Mana** can be thought of as data; even functions. This allows the developer to reason about their program as the flow of data and its transformations, rather than a series of logic statements.

**Salem**, its native compiler, is designed to spot areas of poor performance based on their *data access patterns*, and can respond to this by warning or (optionally) even *automatically* re-organizing the underlying data layouts to achieve the highest performance possible.

It also encourages writing high-performance code with its *extensible type* system, *compile-time reflection* and *lazy evaluation*, and many *zero-cost abstractions*. 

Despite its focus on high performance and expressiveness, **Mana** also does not forego safety. While not quite as safe as **Rust**, **Mana** still has *lifetime-based ownership* constructs and *data race protection*.

All in all, **Mana**'s ultimate goal is to enable *Sourcerers* to work their magic as smoothly as possible.
